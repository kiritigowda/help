## Hardware Acceleration for Machine Learning and Computer Vision through Khronos Open Standard APIs

**Date:** Thursday, May 23, 2019 from 9:00 am - 5:00 pm

### Part 1 - OpenVX

#### Agenda

* OpenVX Introduction - OpenVX Chair (Frank Brill) - 15 min
* MIVisionX Neural Net Classification Application - AMD (Mike, Rajy & Kiriti) - 1.5 hrs
* An efficient workflow for portable computer vision algorithms using OpenVX - Axis (Niclas & Mikael) - 30 min

### OpenVX Introduction
**Speaker:** Frank Brill - OpenVX Chair
Brief introduction to OpenVX API and OpenVX Spec applications

### MIVisionX Neural Net Application

**Speaker:** Mike Schmit - Director Software Engineering, AMD
* Brief introduction to MIVisionX and AMDs open source commitment in neural network domain.

**Speaker:** Kiriti & Rajy, AMD

Hands-on application creation using AMDs Open Source implementation of OpenVX, OpenCV interop and pre-trained neural net model.

* Convert Pre-trained models in NNEF/ONNX to OpenVX graph
* Adding pre and post-processing nodes to the graph
* Running the application on an image or pre-recorded video or live video
* Beyond classification


### An efficient workflow for portable computer vision algorithms using OpenVX
**Speaker:** Niclas & Mikael, AXIS
* Graphical design of algorithms
  * Going beyond the simple C-API
  * Draw the algorithm and generate the code

* Chasing portable performance
  * How portable did it get?
  * How long did it take to develop?
  * Performance comparisons of ported code.
