# NSF I/UCRC Consortium for Embedded Systems at Southern Illinois University Carbondale

The NSF Center for Embedded Systems (CES) is a research collaboration between academia (Southern Illinois University Carbondale and Arizona State University), Industry (leading embedded systems companies throughout the world) and government agencies (the National Science Foundation and other agencies). Its purpose is to advance in the field of 
embedded systems (hardware, software, and architectures) to new levels; thereby, sharing resulting advancements and commercializing applications in automotive, aerospace and micro-electronics to advance commerce.

## Project Ideas for AMD

* **Fused Single Kernel Neural Network Model** - A pre-trained neural network model in ONNX or NNEF format needs to ingested by a tool to create a single kernel node in OpenVX using OpenCL (MIVisionX & MIOpen) which handles all optimizations within the kernel.

* **Cascading Models** - Train or use pre-trained models to develop an application which runs a lightweight model, which is optimized to use less power and resources, to detect some object or scene to trigger running of a more complex model, which does detection of a scene or segmentation, to complete any given task.

* **Image Style Transfers** - Use neural networks or traditional computer vision algorithms to create image styles library for different effects to a given image. This image style transfer kernels can be a module in MIVisionX which can be used in pre or post-processing.

* **Neural Nets for Video Games** - Train a pre-existing model or create a new model to give the user better play suggestions in a video game. Suggested video games Fornite or Destiny 2

* **Neural Network Plugin for Flight Simulation** - Create a model to learn flying an airplane using flight simulators

* **Neural Network for DNA Analysis** - Analysis for DNA for medical research using Neural Networks

* **Security Cameras** - Use pre-trained or create new models to be used for automated surveillance in airports, malls etc

* **E-mail scanning** - Read emails to scan for spam using neural networks.
