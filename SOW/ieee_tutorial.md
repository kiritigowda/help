# Hands-on OpenVX Inference Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will learn how to run inference efficiently using OpenVX and OpenVX Extensions.
[OpenVX](https://www.khronos.org/openvx/) is an open, royalty-free standard for cross platform acceleration of computer vision applications. 
It is designed by the Khronos Group to facilitate portable, optimized and power-efficient processing of methods for vision algorithms.

The tutorial will go over each step required to convert a pre-trained neural net model into an OpenVX Graph and run this 
graph efficiently on any target hardware.

In this tutorial, we will also learn about AMD MIVisionX which delivers open source implementation of
OpenVX and OpenVX Extensions along with Neural Net Model Compiler & Optimizer.

[MIVisionX](https://gpuopen-professionalcompute-libraries.github.io/MIVisionX/) toolkit is a set of comprehensive computer vision and machine intelligence libraries,
utilities, and applications bundled into a single toolkit. AMD MIVisionX delivers highly optimized open source
implementation of the Khronos OpenVX™ and OpenVX™ Extensions along with Convolution Neural Net Model Compiler
& Optimizer supporting ONNX, and Khronos NNEF™ exchange formats. The toolkit allows for rapid prototyping and 
deployment of optimized workloads on a wide range of computer hardware, including small embedded x86 CPUs, APUs,
discrete GPUs, and heterogeneous servers.

The tutorial will give the attendees hands-on experience with neural nets and help them create an inference engine.
